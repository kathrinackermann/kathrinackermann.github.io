My research covers different aspects of **Empirical Democracy Research**. It relates to the fields of Comparative Politics, Political Behavior and Public Opinion Research and draws on theories and approaches from Political Psychology and Political Sociology. I am particularly interested in how individual and contextual factors interact in affecting political participation, political attitudes and attitudes towards democracy. Empirically, I apply **quantitative methods** and adopt a **comparative perspective** (subnational or cross-national comparison with a focus on Western democracies). Below, you find information on my **research agenda** as well as ongoing and completed **externally funded research projects**.

## Research Agenda

### 1. Citizens and Democracy 
I am interested in the way citizens participate in politics and society and how they evaluate the political system and their very own role in this system. Thus, I study civic engagement, aspects of social cohesion, attitudes towards democracy and norms of good citizenship. I analyze how contextual factors (e.g. institutions, social structure, opinion climate) and societal changes (e.g. digitalization, demographic change, polarization) affect civic engagement and attitudes towards democracy.
[*Current Working Papers:*]
* Measuring Citizenship Norms using Open-ended Questions (with Alexander Seitz) 
* Measuring Citizenship Norms using Conjoint Experiments
* Attitudes towards Non-Citizen Voting (with Jessica Kuhlmann)

### 2. Social Structure and Politics
Individuals are embedded in various social contexts. They belong to social groups and think and act politically within these structures. I am studying how their position within society (e.g. their spatial position as rural or urban dweller) relates to their political attitudes and behaviors.
[*Current Working Papers:*]
* The Rural-Urban Divide in Citizen Discontent (with Antonia Lang) 
* Civic Engagement, Political Participation and the Educational Divide (with Franziska Brandt)
[*Completed Project:*]

### 3. Consequences of Societal Change
In the face of far-reaching social changes, I am particularly interested in how these processes (e.g. digitalization, ecological transformation, ageing societies) affect individual action and social cohesion.
* Measuring Online Political Participation in Surveys [*presented at ECPR 2017, Sektion Methoden 2018*]
* Social Media Activities and Voting Behavior (with Isabelle Stadelmann-Steffen)
* Welfare State Policies and Volunteering (with Julian Erhardt und Markus Freitag)
