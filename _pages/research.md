> My research covers different aspects of **Empirical Democracy Research**. It relates to the fields of Comparative Politics, Political Behavior and Public Opinion Research and draws on theories and approaches from Political Psychology and Political Sociology. I am particularly interested in studying how societal changes and conflicts affect political and social behavior as well as political attitudes and attitudes towards democracy. Empirically, I apply **quantitative methods** and adopt a **comparative perspective** (subnational or cross-national comparison with a focus on Western democracies). Below, you find information on my **Research Agenda** and current **Research Projects**.

## Research Agenda

### 1. Rural-Urban Divides in Politics
In collaboration with Richard Traunmüller (U Mannheim/ GU Frankfurt) and Sigrid Roßteutscher (GU Frankfurt), I study rural-urban divides in German and European politics. We are particularly interested in studying political behavior and attitudes towards democracy.

#### - Rural-Urban Divide in Germany (with Sigrid Rossteutscher and Richard Traunmüller) [*presented at AK Wahlen 2018, ECPR 2018*]
#### -- The Rural-Urban Divide in Citizen Discontent (with Richard Traunmüller) [*presented at EPSA 2019*]

### 2. Citizens and Democracy in Times of Societal Change
I am interested in the way citizens participate in politics and society and how they evaluate the political system and their very own role in this system. Thus, I study civic engagement, aspects of social cohesion, attitudes towards democracy and norms of good citizenship. I analyze how contextual factors (e.g. institutions, social structure, opinion climate) and societal changes (e.g. digitalization, demographic change, polarization) affect civic engagement and attitudes towards democracy.

* Institutions and Citizenship Norms [*presented at MPSA 2017, AK Wahlen 2017*]
* Personality and Citizenship Norms [*presented at SVPW 2018*]

#### 3. Psychology and Politics
Building on my PhD project (see publications), I study how personality relates to political attitudes and behavior of citizens and elites. I am particularly interested in the interaction of personality traits and contextual factors and stimuli.

* Personality and Political Consumerism (with Birte Gundelach) [*presented at ISPP 2015*]
* Electoral Losing and Preferences for Direct Democracy (with Hannah Werner and Anna Kern) [*presented at NIG 2017, MPSA 2018, DVPW 2018*]
* Personality, Institutions and Satisfaction with Democracy [*presented at 3LT 2016, MPSA 2017, PolEtmaal 2017*]
* Personality, Electoral Competition and Ideology

### 4. Survey Research
From a methodological perspective, I am particularly interested in Survey Research. I study the validity of commonly used survey measures and I try to delevop innovative and better measures for concepts used in Empirical Democracy Research.

* Left-right scale as a common space for political parties (with Tom van der Meer and Huib Pellikaan)
* Measuring Online Political Participation in Surveys [*presented at ECPR 2017, Sektion Methoden 2018*]
* Measuring Citizenship Norms Using Experimental Approaches
