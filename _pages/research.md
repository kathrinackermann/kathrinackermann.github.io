My research covers different aspects of **Empirical Democracy Research**. It relates to the fields of Comparative Politics, Political Behavior and Public Opinion Research and draws on theories and approaches from Political Psychology and Political Sociology. I am particularly interested in how individual and contextual factors interact in affecting political participation, political attitudes and attitudes towards democracy. Empirically, I apply **quantitative methods** and adopt a **comparative perspective** (subnational or cross-national comparison with a focus on Western democracies). Below, you find information on my **research agenda** as well as ongoing and completed **externally funded research projects**.

## Research Agenda

### 1. Citizens and Democracy 
I am interested in the way citizens participate in politics and society and how they evaluate the political system and their very own role in this system. Thus, I study civic engagement, aspects of social cohesion, attitudes towards democracy and norms of good citizenship. I analyze how contextual factors (e.g. institutions, social structure, opinion climate) and societal changes (e.g. digitalization, demographic change, polarization) affect civic engagement and attitudes towards democracy.

#### *Current Working Papers:*
* Measuring Citizenship Norms using Open-ended Questions (with Alexander Seitz) 
* Measuring Citizenship Norms using Conjoint Experiments
* Attitudes towards Non-Citizen Voting (with Jessica Kuhlmann)

#### *Completed Projects:*
* 2020: Intergenerational Transmission of Citizenship Norms (U Heidelberg Excellence Strategy, PI)
* 2017 - 2018: Citizenship Norms Revisited - Concept and Conditions (SNSF Early Postdoc.Mobility Grant, PI)


### 2. Social Structure and Politics
Individuals are embedded in various social contexts. They belong to social groups and think and act politically within these structures. I am studying how their position within society (e.g. their spatial position as rural or urban dweller) relates to their political attitudes and behaviors.  

#### *Current Working Papers:*
* The Rural-Urban Divide in Citizen Discontent (with Antonia Lang) 
* Civic Engagement, Political Participation and the Educational Divide (with Franziska Brandt)  

#### *Completed Project:*
* 2021 - 2023: The Rural-Urban Divide in Europe (RUDE) (NORFACE Grant, Team Member)


### 3. Consequences of Societal Change
In the face of far-reaching social changes, I am particularly interested in how these processes (e.g. digitalization, ecological transformation, ageing societies) affect individual action and social cohesion.  

#### *Current Working Papers:*
* The Potential of Caring Communities (with Annette Haußmann and Stefanie Wiloth)  

#### *Completed Projects:*
* 2021 - 2023: Experienced solidarity: values, motives and practices in caring communities and social volunteering (EXPSOLIDARITY) (U Heidelberg Excellence Strategy, Co-PI)
* 2020 - 2023: Blackbox Sustainability (U Heidelberg Excellence Strategy, Co-PI)
