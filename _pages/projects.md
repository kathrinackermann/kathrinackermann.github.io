## Ongoing Research Projects

### The Rural-Urban Divide in Europe
*Funding Period:* 01.01.2021 - 31.12.2023  
*Funding Scheme:* NORFACE ("Democratic Governance in a Turbulent Age" Research Programme)  
*Project Team:* Sigrid Roßteutscher (GU Frankfurt – Teamleader, PI), Richard Traunmüller (U Mannheim), Kathrin Ackermann (U Heidelberg), Sascha Göbel (GU Frankfurt)  
*Short Summary:*   
The project examines whether and how urban-rural residency is related to divides in legitimacy beliefs, social identities, perceptions of injustice and threat, political and social attitudes and political behavior of European citizens. It deals with shifting identities and their consequences for democratic governance and political representation and also examines the role of globalization.

### Blackbox Sustainability
*Funding Period:* 15.09.2020 - 14.09.2023  
*Funding Scheme:* Excellence Strategy (EXU, U Heidelberg Field of Focus 4 "Regulation and Self-Regulation")  
*Project Team:* Kathrin Ackermann (PI), Jan Rummel (PI), Nils Brandenstein, Isabelle Neumann, Alina Reissenberger, Franziska Scholl
*Short Summary:*   
The aim of the interdisciplinary project is to integrate disciplinary approaches to explain ecologically sustainable behavior. The project combines individual explanatory approaches from the behavioral sciences, which point, for example, to a pronounced intention-behavior gap, with findings on the influence of contextual conditions, such as policy design. The relevance of the influencing factors and their interaction is first assessed by machine learning methods using survey data. Subsequent experiments test the mechanisms of action.

## Completed Research Projects

### Intergenerational Transmission of Citizenship Norms
*Funding Period:* 01.10.2020 - 31.12.2020  
*Funding Scheme:* Excellence Strategy (EXU, U Heidelberg Flagship Initiative "Transforming Cultural Heritage")  
*Project Team:* Kathrin Ackermann (PI), Alina Reissenberger  
*Short Summary:*   
The research project is dedicated to citizenship norms and their intergenerational transmission. It makes an important contribution to the understanding of norms as essential aspects of social cohesion and an intangible cultural heritage of a society. The research project focuses on the collection and analysis of survey data by means of a representative online survey.

### Citizenship Norms Revisited - Concept and Conditions
*Funding Period:* 01.05.2017 - 31.03.2018  
*Funding Scheme:* SNSF Early Postdoc.Mobility Grant   
*Short Summary:*   
The project deals with the role of citizens in modern societies. It focuses on the question of what constitutes a good citizen. It will be investigated whether civic norms are comparable across different developed democracies and what shapes these norms. In particular, the influence of psychological and institutional factors is analyzed.
